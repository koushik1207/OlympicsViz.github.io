<center><div style="margin:30px"><p>This visualization represents the cumilative sum of medals & their breakdown in terms of Gold, Silver and Bronze.
The visual is of the top 10 medal grossing countries in the Olympics History. The Olympics in its entirety has been dominated by these 10
countries and it is evident that their performance as a nation has always been top tier. This elite club of 10 countries has some interesting
members too. While most countries in the Elite club have a constant growth, countries like Russia, Australia, Sweden and Germany have interesting
stories to tell. The Russian Federation has a major spike in their athelitic abilities and the accolades it has brought them around the 1900s even with the 
bycott of the LA Games around the Cold War era. Although the most drastic spike is from Australia. They rose to supremacy in the cumilative count club after the 1950s with the spike suddenly
rising to 3 digit scores. So was the case with Sweden who's spike is similar to Australia but around early 1900s. Germany has the most interesting 
story by far, given it's history and involvement in the World Wars and Aryan Supremacy theory. USA and China have been top grossers of all times in the Olympics History and have by far the strong hold
in athelitic Superiority.

Interesting take on this visualization is that the Caliber metric is based off of the cumilative count of medals in their Olympics stint and not just the amount of Gold Medals won.
Some countries have really low Gold medal count but are part of this Elite Club due to their count of medals especially Bronze Medal. On a world stage, an Olympic medal is a really 
big achievement and the above fact does not dismiss or undermine their efforts.</p><br>
